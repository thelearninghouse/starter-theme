/*
 * Bones Scripts File
 * Author: Eddie Machado
 *
 * This file should contain any js scripts you want to add to the site.
 * Instead of calling it in the header or throwing it inside wp_head()
 * this file will be called automatically in the footer so as not to
 * slow the page load.
 *
 * There are a lot of example functions and tools in here. If you don't
 * need any of it, just remove it. They are meant to be helpers and are
 * not required. It's your world baby, you can do whatever you want.
*/

/*
 * Put all your regular jQuery in here.
*/
jQuery(document).ready(function($) {


}); /* end of as page load scripts */
